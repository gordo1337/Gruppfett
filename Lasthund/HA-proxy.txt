HAProxy stands for High Availability Proxy, it is a free and open source load balancer tool which allow to balance the incoming traffic (TCP and HTTP based) by distributing across the backend servers using different criteria.

In other words, we can say HAProxy is used to provide fault tolerance and high availability in case when one node is getting too many concurrent requests. It is used by most famous web sites like GitHub, Stack Overflow and Tumbler.

In this article, we will discuss how to install and configure HAProxy on CentOS 8/RHEL 8 for Nginx Web Servers. Following are the details for my haproxy lab setup,
##

    -HAProxy Server – 192.168.1.10 (haproxy-centos8)
    -Nginx Server 1 – 192.168.1.11 (nginx-node01)
    -Nginx Server 2 – 192.168.1.12 (nginx-node01)
#Let’s jump into installation and configuration steps of HAProxy on CentOS 8 / RHEL 8

##
#STEP 1 Update /etc/hosts fiel of your HAProxy Server

Login to your CentOS 8 or RHEL 8 system where you will install haproxy, add the following lines in /etc/hosts file,

```
192.168.1.10    haproxy-centos8
192.168.1.11    nginx-node01
192.168.1.12    nginx-node02

```
After updating the hosts file, make sure you are able to ping Nginx nodes,

##
#STEP 2 Install and Configure HAProcy on CENTOS 8

#Haproxy package is available in the default package repositories of CentOS 8 and RHEL 8, so it can be easily installed with dnf command. But it is recommended update your system before installing haproxy. So execute the following command,
##

```

root@haproxy-centos8 ~]# dnf update -y
root@haproxy-centos8 ~]# reboot

```

#Now use following dnf command to install haproxy,

```

[root@haproxy-centos8 ~]# dnf install haproxy

```

#Once the haproxy is installed successfully, configure it by editing its configuration file “/etc/haproxy/haproxy.cfg“.

Before editing the file, it is always a good practice to make a backup of original file , run the following command,
##

```
[root@haproxy-centos8 ~]# cd /etc/haproxy/
[root@haproxy-centos8 haproxy]# cp haproxy.cfg haproxy.cfg-org
[root@haproxy-centos8 haproxy]#

```

##
In configuration file, we will modify two sections frontend and backend. In Frontend section we define the haproxy IP and its port, stats uri and backend name. In Backend section we define the type of  load balance algorithm we will use like round robin & least connection etc and backend server’s name, IPs and port, example is demonstrated below,
##

```

[root@haproxy-centos8 haproxy]# vi haproxy.cfg
…………………
frontend http_balancer
    bind 192.168.1.10:80
    option http-server-close
    option forwardfor
    stats uri /haproxy?stats

#    acl url_static       path_beg       -i /static /images /javascript /stylesheets
#    acl url_static       path_end       -i .jpg .gif .png .css .js
#    use_backend static          if url_static
    default_backend     nginx_webservers

backend nginx_webservers
    mode        http
    balance     roundrobin
    option httpchk HEAD / HTTP/1.1\r\nHost:\ localhost    
    server  nginx-node01  192.168.1.11:80  check
    server  nginx-node02  192.168.1.12:80  check

```
# Save and exit the file
##

#Configure rsyslog so that it stores all HAProxy statistics, edit rsyslog config file “/etc/rsyslog.conf” and uncomment line 19 and 20,
##

```
[root@haproxy-centos8 ~]# vi /etc/rsyslog.conf
……
module(load="imudp")
input(type="imudp" port="514")
```

# Save and exit the file.
# Now create Now create haproxy.conf file for rsyslog , paste the following lines,

```

[root@haproxy-centos8 ~]# vi /etc/rsyslog.d/haproxy.conf
local2.=info     /var/log/haproxy-access.log
local2.notice    /var/log/haproxy-info.log

```

# Save and exit the file 
# Restart and enable rsyslog service so that it will be avaliable across # the reebots

```

[root@haproxy-centos8 ~]# systemctl restart rsyslog
[root@haproxy-centos8 ~]# systemctl enable rsyslog


```

# Now finally start haproxy but before starting haproxy service, set the # following selinux rule

```

[root@haproxy-centos8 ~]# setsebool -P haproxy_connect_any 1

```

# Start & enable haproxy using beneath systemctl commands

```

[root@haproxy-centos8 ~]# systemctl start haproxy
[root@haproxy-centos8 ~]# systemctl enable haproxy

```

# Allow the haproxy port (in our case it is 80) in OS firewall, execute  # the beneath firewall-cmd command,

```

[root@haproxy-centos8 ~]# firewall-cmd --permanent --add-port=80/tcp
[root@haproxy-centos8 ~]# firewall-cmd --reload

```

# Till now HAProxy installation and configuration part is completed let’s # move to Nginx nodes,

##! This part is maybe not nessasarcy because of Web01 and Web02 !##

## STEP 3 Install NGINX and start its service 

#Login to both nginx nodes, install nginx and start its service using the #following commands.

```

# dnf install nginx -y
# systemctl start nginx
# systemctl enable nginx

```

#Let’s modify the index.html file of respective node,

## For nginx-node01 #!(web01)!#

´´´
[root@nginx-node01 ~]# cd /usr/share/nginx/html
[root@nginx-node01 html]# echo "Nginx Node01 - Welcome to First Nginx Web Server" > index.html
```

##For nginx-node02 #!(web02)!#

``´

[root@nginx-node02 ~]# cd /usr/share/nginx/html
[root@nginx-node02 html]# echo "Nginx Node02 - Welcome to 2nd Nginx Web Server" > index.html

```

#Allow Nginx port (80) in the OS firewall in both nodes using below command,

```
# firewall-cmd --permanent --add-service=http
# firewall-cmd --reload
```

## STEP 4 Test if your HAProxy is working properly or not

# Login to haproxy server and run the curl command couple of times to see whether traffic is distributed in round-robin way

```
[root@haproxy-centos8 ~]# curl 192.168.1.10 #!(192-168.40.20)!#

```

##Perfect, this confirms haproxy is working properly as it is distributing traffic between two nodes,

#Let’s verify from the Web browser too,

#Above confirms that HAProxy has configured successfully on CentOS 8 and RHEL 8.

#You can view the status of your haproxy via web browser, type url : http://<HA-Proxy-IP>/haproxy?stat


#In our case URL will be http://192.168.1.10/haproxy?stats

##
We can also view HAProxy statistics from log file ( /var/log/haproxy-access.log).

That’s all from this tutorial, I hope these steps help you to setup HAProxy on CentOS 8 and RHEL 8 smoothly. Please do share your valuable feedback and comments.
